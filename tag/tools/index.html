    <p class="meta"><i><p>While I liked <a href="https://prose.sh">prose.sh</a> as a blog provider I have found that the workflow doesn’t quite suit me. I would prefer something less magical and a bit more <a href="https://boringtechnology.club">boring</a>. As the basis of <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> and written in ruby, a language I keep coming back to, I decided that <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> qualified for me.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i>In the distant past (2005-2009) I took a lot of photos of old documents as part of a personal digitisation effort. Because of a lack of personal storage much of the time these were organised in a simple hierarchy based on that of the archive and then groups were burned to DVD. These DVDs were also shared with others to get their copy, and sometimes I also received DVDs of images others had made, our organisational strategy were not necessarily the same. Anyway, I ended up with a few hundred DVDs with lots and lots of images on them, some unique to one DVD and others duplicated on two or more, and possibly organised in different ways.</i></p>

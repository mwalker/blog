    <p class="meta"><i><p>An interesting article about <a href="https://peelarchivesblog.com/2024/09/10/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes/">archival storage practice in North America and the UK</a>, interesting to see that as in many things Australian practice (at least that I have experienced) is a mash-up of both.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>I have a collected a few of these over the years. Small ones I store in boxes, a bit larger ones in a portfolio case.  The larger ones I have however are generally all rolled. I’ve learned from PROV how bad it is to store these really tightly, and the way I was doing it vertically in an open topped tea chest box was never a good system and was really untenable when moving was on the cards.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>I first came across <a href="https://www.albox.com.au">Albox</a> because of their <a href="https://www.albox.com.au/product/type-1-p-180-storage-box/">archival storage boxes</a> made from polypropylene. They are great value in bulk, large enough to hold a reasonable amount of files, but small enough that you don’t overload them. For papers and files I much prefer this size to the standard commercial archive box, and I can see why for institutions like <a href="https://prov.vic.gov.au">PROV</a> and <a href="https://www.naa.gov.au">NAA</a> these are the preferred form factor.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>Organising all my <s>junk</s> treasures I have of course delved deeply into the world of the best way to store all this stuff, in a way that I can find and access it, it’s still a journey (I need an index) but I thought I’d share some of the things that work for me.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i>In the distant past (2005-2009) I took a lot of photos of old documents as part of a personal digitisation effort. Because of a lack of personal storage much of the time these were organised in a simple hierarchy based on that of the archive and then groups were burned to DVD. These DVDs were also shared with others to get their copy, and sometimes I also received DVDs of images others had made, our organisational strategy were not necessarily the same. Anyway, I ended up with a few hundred DVDs with lots and lots of images on them, some unique to one DVD and others duplicated on two or more, and possibly organised in different ways.</i></p>

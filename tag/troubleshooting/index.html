    <p class="meta"><i><p>Just a quick note in case anyone finds this on the internet (and for me in the future), since I haven’t been able to find anything similar in my searching. In the last few days we thought the old TV was dying because the bottom right corner was darker with a gradient extending in an arc from just over halfway along the bottom edge to just over halway along the right hand edge. Eventually I worked out it was just in the YouTube app, and then if I restarted the YouTube app it went away, until near the end of the first video when it re-appeared, and stayed for every subsequent video. I’ve tried a number of different things, updating the app and tvOS, changing a bunch of settings on the Apple TV, replacing cables, and swapping the TV, nothing has helped. Then I decided to log out of YouTube Premium, and bingo all is OK (except for the ads!). Log back in and it is back, disabling auto-play also fixes it, but we use it a lot for background so that is not really sustainable either.</p>

<p>Digging around on <a href="https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/">Yahoo Japan Auctions</a> I came across the <a href="https://www.logitec.co.jp/">Logitec</a> (yes, no “h” it’s not the one you are thinking of) <a href="https://www.mac-paradise.com/htmls/4992072117051-1.html">LCW-T1210BSU</a> an intriguing looking CD-RW unit that supports both SCSI and USB. <a href="https://page.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/t1088610088">This particular auction</a> was for a pair of them and did not seem to be evincing much interest, but was priced a lot less than the straight out adapters. Thinking this could be a way to get some adapters cheap I set out to do a bit more research.</p>

<p>Thankfully Logitec still have a <a href="https://www.logitec.co.jp/down/soft/cdr/lcwt1210bsu.html">drivers page for the LCW-T1210BSU</a> online, and poking around on that it seems the CD-RW drive is actually a [TEAC CD-W512EB], which is an IDE drive so it seems this Logitec case must have both a USB to IDE and a SCSI to IDE adapter within it. Considering that modern USB to IDE apapters are very cheap I think it would only be useful for someone who needs a SCSI to IDE adapter, and it seems like it might be fairly custom, so no luck for me but perhaps useful to someone.</p>

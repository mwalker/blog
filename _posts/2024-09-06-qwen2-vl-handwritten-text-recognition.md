[Simon Willison's post on his experience with Qwen2-VL](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/4/qwen2-vl/) is really promising. I'm glad I have held off with doing much more than simple experiments so far in the hope that something this accurate would come along. If the results shown here can be generalised across the corpus that I am interested in then I think it promises great things.

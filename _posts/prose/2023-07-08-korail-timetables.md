Researching a trip to Korea I found it difficult to use the online tools to plan trips, especially when there are connections involved. So far I have not found a tool that works as well as the sadly lobotomised [Hyperdia](https://www.hyperdia.com/) used to work for Japan, or even as well as the combination of [JapanTravel](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/) and [JapanTransit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/japan-transit-planner/id299490481) that I use today does.

Thankfully the open government data law in South Korea comes to our rescue, some spelunking turned up [Korail's raw timetable and fare data](https://www.letskorail.com/ebizcom/cs/guide/guide/guide11.do) available for download as heavily customised Excel spreadsheets. Using Safari and Brave on a Mac there is some funkiness with character encoding for the filenames, and the identification of the file type is as a zip, but it is an xlsx and does open properly in Excel.

As an aside as an English-only speaker this is the most approachable [Korean railway map](https://korearailway.com/en/railroad-route-map-in-south-korea/) that I found although I think it is a little bit out of date, in particular I think Gyeongju station is now closed. I also found this a [good description of the types of passenger trains in South Korea](https://theraillife.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/south-korea-korail/).

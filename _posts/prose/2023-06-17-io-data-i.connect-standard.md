While trawling [Yahoo Japan Auctions](https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/) for cheap(er) FireWire or USB to SCSI adapters, I came across some seemingly cheap ones. Something seemed off but it was hard to work out from the machine translated Japanese what that was initially.

Digging deeper they were converters to something called i•CONNECT, not SCSI, although the connector looks the same as one used for SCSI, it seems this was an interface standard for peripherals from the Japanese company [I-O DATA DEVICE, INC.](https://www.iodata.jp/). They maintain some pages still:

- [i•CONNECT](https://www.iodata.jp/products/iconnect/main.htm)
- [i•CONNECT+](https://www.iodata.jp/products/iconnect/iconnectplus.htm) - seems to just be adding IEEE1394 or USB2.0 interfaces to devices in addition to i•CONNECT
- [i•CONNECT USB adapter/device compatibility chart](https://www.iodata.jp/products/iconnect/sheet.htm)
- [i•CONNECT IEE1394/FireWire adapter/device compatibility chart](https://www.iodata.jp/products/iconnect/sheet2.htm)

I haven't been able to find anything in English, I guess it suffers from it's name being overloaded with some very common words.

Devices I have seen are:

- 1394-iCN
- 1394-iCN2
- 1394-iCN3
- USB-iCN
- USB-iCN2
- USB2-iCN
- USB2-iCN/W

Another international trip coming up and it is time to stock up on face masks. In order to deal with wearing a mask for more than an hour or so I have found a head loop to be much more comfortable than ear loops. Before my last trip I tried a bunch of different brands but the one I found the most comfortable was the [Softmed SM-SR202](https://softmed.com.au/product/n95-flat-folded-particular-respirator-and-surgical-mask-on-comfort-headloop/) N95 with headloops (also available in a version with ear loops as well). This was the one I wore almost exclusively during that trip.

Previously I have bought these from [Platinum Health Supply](https://www.platinumhealthsupply.com.au/products/flat-fold-n95-p2-respirator-head-strap-australian-made) but this time I made an order direct with [Softmed](https://softmed.com.au/).

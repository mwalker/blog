    <p class="meta"><i><p>While I liked <a href="https://prose.sh">prose.sh</a> as a blog provider I have found that the workflow doesn’t quite suit me. I would prefer something less magical and a bit more <a href="https://boringtechnology.club">boring</a>. As the basis of <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> and written in ruby, a language I keep coming back to, I decided that <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> qualified for me.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>I have a collected a few of these over the years. Small ones I store in boxes, a bit larger ones in a portfolio case.  The larger ones I have however are generally all rolled. I’ve learned from PROV how bad it is to store these really tightly, and the way I was doing it vertically in an open topped tea chest box was never a good system and was really untenable when moving was on the cards.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>More digging around on <a href="https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/">Yahoo Japan Auctions</a> turned a board with the ID <em>RXB2-001-1</em> that looked like it was a USB to SCSI adapter. As it was reasonably cheap I thought I would take a punt. When it arrived here it was fairly clear that is what it must be as one of the chips was stamped “adaptec”.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>Another international trip coming up and it is time to stock up on face masks. In order to deal with wearing a mask for more than an hour or so I have found a head loop to be much more comfortable than ear loops. Before my last trip I tried a bunch of different brands but the one I found the most comfortable was the <a href="https://softmed.com.au/product/n95-flat-folded-particular-respirator-and-surgical-mask-on-comfort-headloop/">Softmed SM-SR202</a> N95 with headloops (also available in a version with ear loops as well). This was the one I wore almost exclusively during that trip.</p>

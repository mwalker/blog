<p>Researching a trip to Korea I found it difficult to use the online tools to plan trips, especially when there are connections involved. So far I have not found a tool that works as well as the sadly lobotomised <a href="https://www.hyperdia.com/">Hyperdia</a> used to work for Japan, or even as well as the combination of <a href="https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/">JapanTravel</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/japan-transit-planner/id299490481">JapanTransit</a> that I use today does.</p>

<p>Thankfully the open government data law in South Korea comes to our rescue, some spelunking turned up <a href="https://www.letskorail.com/ebizcom/cs/guide/guide/guide11.do">Korail’s raw timetable and fare data</a> available for download as heavily customised Excel spreadsheets. Using Safari and Brave on a Mac there is some funkiness with character encoding for the filenames, and the identification of the file type is as a zip, but it is an xlsx and does open properly in Excel.</p>

<p>As an aside as an English-only speaker this is the most approachable <a href="https://korearailway.com/en/railroad-route-map-in-south-korea/">Korean railway map</a> that I found although I think it is a little bit out of date, in particular I think Gyeongju station is now closed. I also found this a <a href="https://theraillife.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/south-korea-korail/">good description of the types of passenger trains in South Korea</a>.</p>

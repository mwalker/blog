<p>I have a collected a few of these over the years. Small ones I store in boxes, a bit larger ones in a portfolio case.  The larger ones I have however are generally all rolled. I’ve learned from PROV how bad it is to store these really tightly, and the way I was doing it vertically in an open topped tea chest box was never a good system and was really untenable when moving was on the cards.</p>

<p>The best solution I found were the archival cardboard <a href="https://www.archivalsurvival.com.au/search?q=roll+plan">roll plan boxes from Archival Survival</a>. These are tough and look after the contents well. They feel like they need three hands to put together but you get the knack after a while. I think you could stack these five or six high with no issues.</p>

<p>For things that are already flat I have found the <a href="https://www.eckersleys.com.au/mindrex-coreflute-black-portfolios">corflute portfolios available from Eckersley’s</a> to be the best solution, but these top out at B1 size (actually now they seem to be only up to A1). I’d love to find an A0 or even B0 equivalent. I did have a set of old steel plan drawers but these were heavy and awkward. The other thing to investigate is bags and hanging storage, but I haven’t had enough of these sort of plans to justify that yet.</p>

<p>This is the third in a series on the <a href="/tag/storage/">storage</a> solutions that work for me.</p>

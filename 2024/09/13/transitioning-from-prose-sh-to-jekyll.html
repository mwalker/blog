<p>While I liked <a href="https://prose.sh">prose.sh</a> as a blog provider I have found that the workflow doesn’t quite suit me. I would prefer something less magical and a bit more <a href="https://boringtechnology.club">boring</a>. As the basis of <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> and written in ruby, a language I keep coming back to, I decided that <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> qualified for me.</p>

<p>There’s no way to extract the raw blog posts from prose.sh without asking them, thanksully jekyll has a fairly well developed import plugin, and I was able to crib from the existing one for tumblr to create a simple one for prose.sh posts retrieved by spidering the site. I could use the “permalink” configuaration item in the frontmatter in order to keep the old URL structure for each post.</p>

<p>Setting up jekyll it seems like the github-pages version is a bit behind the latest, and I wasn’t sure I wanted to get too locked into github either, so I went with the current latest, jekyll 4.3.3. I struggled to find a them that I liked so I ended up doing my own, heavily cribbed from <a href="https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/">no style please</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kevquirk/jekyll-simplecss-template">Jekyll Simple.css Template</a>.</p>

<p>I also made use of the <a href="https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2">Jekyll::Paginate V2</a> plugin in order to paginate the posts so the front page doesn’t get unwieldy, and then discovered with its <a href="https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-AUTOPAGES.md">AutoPages</a> feature it can also generate pages for each tag (and potentially category). To get them to sort nicely I had to install the <a href="https://github.com/mslinn/jekyll_sort_natural">jekyll_sort_natural</a> plugin, because the liquid sort_natural doesn’t work for reasons I can’t quite fathom.</p>

<p>Getting it actually deployed on guthub was a bit of a pain, but after a bunch of clicking around it seems to be working. It’s mostly a combination of <a href="https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts">jekyll-action-ts</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages">github pages action</a> combined in a github action job.</p>

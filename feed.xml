I would prefer something less magical and a bit more <a href="https://boringtechnology.club">boring</a>. As the basis of <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> and written in ruby, a language I keep coming back to, I decided that <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> qualified for me.</p>

<p>There’s no way to extract the raw blog posts from prose.sh without asking them, thanksully jekyll has a fairly well developed import plugin, and I was able to crib from the existing one for tumblr to create a simple one for prose.sh posts retrieved by spidering the site. I could use the “permalink” configuaration item in the frontmatter in order to keep the old URL structure for each post.</p>

<p>Setting up jekyll it seems like the github-pages version is a bit behind the latest, and I wasn’t sure I wanted to get too locked into github either, so I went with the current latest, jekyll 4.3.3. I struggled to find a theme that I liked so I ended up doing my own, heavily cribbed from <a href="https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/">no style please</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kevquirk/jekyll-simplecss-template">Jekyll Simple.css Template</a>.</p>

<p>I also made use of the <a href="https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2">Jekyll::Paginate V2</a> plugin in order to paginate the posts so the front page doesn’t get unwieldy, and then discovered with its <a href="https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-AUTOPAGES.md">AutoPages</a> feature it can also generate pages for each tag (and potentially category). To get them to sort nicely I had to install the <a href="https://github.com/mslinn/jekyll_sort_natural">jekyll_sort_natural</a> plugin, because the liquid sort_natural doesn’t work for reasons I can’t quite fathom.</p>

<p>Getting it actually deployed on guthub was a bit of a pain, but after a bunch of clicking around it seems to be working. It’s mostly a combination of <a href="https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts">jekyll-action-ts</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages">github pages action</a> combined in a github action job.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="prose.sh" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="blog software" /><category term="tools" /><category term="github" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I liked prose.sh as a blog provider I have found that the workflow doesn’t quite suit me.

Small ones I store in boxes, a bit larger ones in a portfolio case.  The larger ones I have however are generally all rolled. I’ve learned from PROV how bad it is to store these really tightly, and the way I was doing it vertically in an open topped tea chest box was never a good system and was really untenable when moving was on the cards.</p>

<p>The best solution I found were the archival cardboard <a href="https://www.archivalsurvival.com.au/search?q=roll+plan">roll plan boxes from Archival Survival</a>. These are tough and look after the contents well. They feel like they need three hands to put together but you get the knack after a while. I think you could stack these five or six high with no issues.</p>

<p>For things that are already flat I have found the <a href="https://www.eckersleys.com.au/mindrex-coreflute-black-portfolios">corflute portfolios available from Eckersley’s</a> to be the best solution, but these top out at B1 size (actually now they seem to be only up to A1). I’d love to find an A0 or even B0 equivalent. I did have a set of old steel plan drawers but these were heavy and awkward. The other thing to investigate is bags and hanging storage, but I haven’t had enough of these sort of plans to justify that yet.</p>

As it was reasonably cheap I thought I would take a punt. When it arrived here it was fairly clear that is what it must be as one of the chips was stamped “adaptec”.</p>

<p>I wanted to test it out with some original old SCSI drives from some old Macs but due to a number of issues I don’t have them available yet, in anticipation of something in that direction however I have also purchased a <a href="https://zuluscsi.com">ZuluSCSI</a> device, so I thought this thing may be a good thing to try.</p>

<p>Plugging it in initially to a computer using the USB B port on the board and nothing showed up, it also has a barrel socket, so I figured it must need that for power. On the board I purchased “5V” was written in texta on the back, and with both USB and SCSI it seemed very likely that this was the required voltage. There also didn’t look to be anything on the board to change the voltage, and the built in molex connector only had the 5V wire connected. It was still an open question as to the polarity of the barrel connector, but some quick work with the trusty Uni-T multimeter buzzing out ground from the Molex to the outside of the barrel left me reassured it was centre positive like most I come across.</p>

<p>Once powered up using the 5V DC input a device called <em>USB-DFU1</em> appeared on the USB bus, looking promising. The vendor ID is 0x04c8 which corresponds to Konica.</p>

<p>Now we disconnect everything and connect up the ZuluSCSI. Powering on again and we get some flashes from the LED connected to the board but not much else. I’d realise later that the LED on the ZuluSCSI should also be flashing when it is powered. At first I fiddled with the termination, and trying the debug DIP switch on the ZuluSCSI, but getting no debug file. Do some more reading, seems the board is not supplying termination power, so we need to power the ZuluSCSI separately, which we can do through it’s USB port.</p>

<p>Connect all that up and power up again, flashes from the ZuluSCSI LED this time, and lo and behold the HFS volume I have set up on the ZuluSCSI is mounted on my Snow Leopard MacBook Pro, success.</p>

<p>Because the board has a couple of fly leads for connection to a power switch, and I don’t have any blades avaialable for the spade connectors I connected by using the multimeter in current mode. Without load it draws about 150-160 mA. As mentioned it can also power the drive but I did not test that as I was using the ZuluSCSI.</p>

<p>Doing research I found a couple of references on the web to this board in Japanese from <a href="http://nana1451.web.fc2.com/omd.html">nana1451</a> and <a href="http://weblabo.griffonworks.net/dorlog/2nddorcom/pcat/26077.html">ひばり さん</a>, it seems likely it was originally incorporated in a product for a USB connected MO (Magneto-Optical) drive, which were very popular in Japan. Most USB MO drives I have seen come with an external adapter in a cable, usually based on the Shuttle Technologies chip.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="SCSI" /><category term="USB" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[More digging around on Yahoo Japan Auctions turned a board with the ID RXB2-001-1 that looked like it was a USB to SCSI adapter.

<p>After a few goes, putting it down to return to a few times and re-reading the manual the clue was in the re-assembly instructions on <a href="https://archive.org/details/manualzilla-id-7237288/page/n7/mode/2up">page 1-07</a>, we actually need to move the just the rear panel with the ports outward from the rear of the device. It also helps to be pushing down slightly on the top of the extrusion as the disk is spring mounted pushing upwards on to that extrusion. Once the rear panel moves out a bit the extrusion will start to rise a little on the springs. To remove it entirely you may need to peel it off the top of the disk because it is fitted with thermal pad which on mine is a bit tacky and stuck to the disk. This would be why the whole thing would not move backwards, because we were also trying to move the disk which has the sprung pins from the chassis in it’s four bottom mounting points and is therefore secure from fore-aft movement.</p>

These were all bought with only confirmation they powered up, but so far I am 3/3 working, woohoo!</p>

<p>If you manage to get the door stuck open, you need to use the reset tool to get it to close again before you can use the scanner again. This is outlined on page 22 of the <a href="https://www.konicaminoltasupport.com/index.php?id=4071&amp;L=2%25%27%2F%2A%2A%2FaND%2F%2A%2A%2F%278%25%27%3D%273">manual</a> (if you have any old Konica or Minolta digital gear that site is really useful, and kinda unexpected it is still running over fifteen years since selling their camera business to Sony, well done Konica Minolta!).</p>

<p>If you don’t have or can’t find your reset tool (it may be living under the front foot of the scanner, only one of my three still had it), then it is a metal pin like a paperclip and 25-30mm in length. You may have to poke around a little after inserting it to find the latch to release the door.</p>

<p>If you leave the door open you will get odd crashes and spinning beach balls from <a href="https://www.hamrick.com">VueScan</a> when it tries to initialise the scanner, or it won’t be able to complete the calibration step.</p>

<p>If you need a power supply it is 24V DC, minimum 1.5A, with a centre positive 4.8mm x 1.7mm barrel connector. I’m not sure where I got it, but an APD DA-48M24 has worked well for me, just a bit annoying as it needs a cloverleaf mains cable.</p>

<p>Using USB a full 5400dpi scan is taking just under 90s, with another 15s or so to complete saving (a TIFF and a JPEG). I need to test the FireWire port to see if it is any speedier.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="film" /><category term="FireWire" /><category term="minolta" /><category term="scanner" /><category term="USB" /><category term="vuescan" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Started playing with the three Minolta DiMAGE Scan 5400’s I’ve managed to accumulate.

In the past I have manually looked at each package, opened the “Shipping Information” accordion and made notes on a bit of paper, trying to come up with the optimum combinations of purchases to consolidate to the one package for shipping. Finally I decided to make my life a bit easier and I have whipped up a little JavaScript bookmarklet to extract this info and put it in a table at the top of the page, so I can easily cut and paste it out into Excel to play with.</p>

<p>My jQuery was a bit rusty and it’s still a little rough around the edges, but it make accessing this info a lot easier and saves me a bunch of time. Something I discovered is that if you have more than a page of packages (20) there seems to be a Buyee bug where it does not load the dimensions for the extra packages along with the other details. Therefore you need to change the display order and then deal with any duplicates, if you have more than 40 packages then I think you’re stuck.</p>

<p>And a note on encoding, it seems browsers are pretty forgiving, my initial attempt for instance I manually changed all the quotes into " so it would correctly fit in the href attribute of the a tag. Thinking later I realised it is really a URL, so I think the best way is to URL encode it. Because it has both single and double quotes I was strggling with how to get it into a string to call encodeURI() with, some searching turned up a gist, and in particular this comment by @marfillaster on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jaytaylor/5a90c49e0976aadfe0726a847ce58736?permalink_comment_id=4566047#gistcomment-4566047">using jq to URI encode a string</a> which I really liked. Using this I could just pipe my source file into jq and not have to query about getting it into a string.</p>

In the past I have manually looked at each package, opened the “Shipping Information” accordion and made notes on a bit of paper, trying to come up with the optimum combinations of purchases to consolidate to the one package for shipping. Finally I decided to make my life a bit easier and I have whipped up a little JavaScript bookmarklet to extract this info and put it in a table at the top of the page, so I can easily cut and paste it out into Excel to play with.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Booking the JR Kyushu Queen Beetle Ferry</title><link href="/booking-the-jr-kyushu-queen-beetle-ferry" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Booking the JR Kyushu Queen Beetle Ferry" /><published>2023-07-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/booking-the-jr-kyushu-queen-beetle-ferry</id><content type="html" xml:base="/booking-the-jr-kyushu-queen-beetle-ferry"><![CDATA[<p>Preparing for a trip to Japan and Korea later this year we are planning to travel one leg on the <a href="https://www.jrbeetle.com/en/">JR Kyushu Queen Beetle Ferry</a> from Fukuoka to Busan. A couple of tips that might help.</p>

<p>The schedule is only announced a few times a year, potentially only a few months out from when the current schedule expires, until then the booking system, if the schedule for the day you want has not been announced yet the booking system will only give you back the error “Sorry, no ships are available”. You can find a pdf with the end date of the currently announced sailings on the <a href="https://www.jrbeetle.com/en/time-table/">JR Beetle Timetable Page</a>. For instance the announced sailings ended on October 9 until about a week ago, su just under three months.</p>

<p>When booking you are given three levels entitled “Best”, “Good” and “Prime” for each class (economy and business). That stumped us for a while as to what the difference between the levels was. I pored over the map, went through the website, watched some YouTube travel videos, eventually we noticed the <a href="https://www.jrbeetle.com/en/reserve/online/">“Fare Conditions” button which lead to this page</a>, and the meaning was clear, it’s just around fare conditions and the charges for cancelling or changing dates at each price level, not about access to particular seats or anything (I will confirm when the seat reservation opens up seven days ahead of sailing).</p>

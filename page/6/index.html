    <p class="meta"><i><p>I’ve noticed a fair bit of AI generated artwork over the last few months, and in the past week some called Stable Diffusion, which open source and can be run locally has been popular. Then I saw this <a href="https://replicate.com/blog/run-stable-diffusion-on-m1-mac">blog post from Replicate</a> on how to get it running locally on an M1 Mac, which I happen to have. As a break from <a href="/using-catcli-and-sqlite-to-process-old-backup-disks">extracting data from old backup DVDs</a> I thought I would have a play.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>I came across the OpenStick in <a href="http://archive.thesizzle.com.au/issue_1664.html">Issue 1664</a> (public archive may not be live yet) of <a href="https://thesizzle.com.au">The Sizzle</a>, a great Aussie tech newsletter I subscribe to, and it piqued my interest. The idea of a $20 USB powered Linux computer with WiFi and 4G, appealed, especially with the Raspberry Pi being so hard to get at the moment.A</p>

    <p class="meta"><i>In the distant past (2005-2009) I took a lot of photos of old documents as part of a personal digitisation effort. Because of a lack of personal storage much of the time these were organised in a simple hierarchy based on that of the archive and then groups were burned to DVD. These DVDs were also shared with others to get their copy, and sometimes I also received DVDs of images others had made, our organisational strategy were not necessarily the same. Anyway, I ended up with a few hundred DVDs with lots and lots of images on them, some unique to one DVD and others duplicated on two or more, and possibly organised in different ways.</i></p>

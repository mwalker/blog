    <p class="meta"><i><p>I have a collected a few of these over the years. Small ones I store in boxes, a bit larger ones in a portfolio case.  The larger ones I have however are generally all rolled. I’ve learned from PROV how bad it is to store these really tightly, and the way I was doing it vertically in an open topped tea chest box was never a good system and was really untenable when moving was on the cards.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>More digging around on <a href="https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/">Yahoo Japan Auctions</a> turned a board with the ID <em>RXB2-001-1</em> that looked like it was a USB to SCSI adapter. As it was reasonably cheap I thought I would take a punt. When it arrived here it was fairly clear that is what it must be as one of the chips was stamped “adaptec”.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>Another international trip coming up and it is time to stock up on face masks. In order to deal with wearing a mask for more than an hour or so I have found a head loop to be much more comfortable than ear loops. Before my last trip I tried a bunch of different brands but the one I found the most comfortable was the <a href="https://softmed.com.au/product/n95-flat-folded-particular-respirator-and-surgical-mask-on-comfort-headloop/">Softmed SM-SR202</a> N95 with headloops (also available in a version with ear loops as well). This was the one I wore almost exclusively during that trip.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>Recently pulled this out of the collection of stored disks but was struggling to get the case to open. The Internet Archive has a <a href="https://archive.org/details/manualzilla-id-7237288/page/n5/mode/2up">manual for a Cooler Master X Craft 350 Lite</a> which while not the exact model (mine has USB and FireWire. The opening instructions are on page 1-05 (for English) and this method did not work. The top aluminium extrusion would not budge towards the rear of the device.</p>

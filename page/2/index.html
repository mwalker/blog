    <p class="meta"><i><p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/4/qwen2-vl/">Simon Willison’s post on his experience with Qwen2-VL</a> is really promising. I’m glad I have held off with doing much more than simple experiments so far in the hope that something this accurate would come along. If the results shown here can be generalised across the corpus that I am interested in then I think it promises great things.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>I have a collected a few of these over the years. Small ones I store in boxes, a bit larger ones in a portfolio case.  The larger ones I have however are generally all rolled. I’ve learned from PROV how bad it is to store these really tightly, and the way I was doing it vertically in an open topped tea chest box was never a good system and was really untenable when moving was on the cards.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>More digging around on <a href="https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/">Yahoo Japan Auctions</a> turned a board with the ID <em>RXB2-001-1</em> that looked like it was a USB to SCSI adapter. As it was reasonably cheap I thought I would take a punt. When it arrived here it was fairly clear that is what it must be as one of the chips was stamped “adaptec”.</p>

    <p class="meta"><i><p>Another international trip coming up and it is time to stock up on face masks. In order to deal with wearing a mask for more than an hour or so I have found a head loop to be much more comfortable than ear loops. Before my last trip I tried a bunch of different brands but the one I found the most comfortable was the <a href="https://softmed.com.au/product/n95-flat-folded-particular-respirator-and-surgical-mask-on-comfort-headloop/">Softmed SM-SR202</a> N95 with headloops (also available in a version with ear loops as well). This was the one I wore almost exclusively during that trip.</p>
